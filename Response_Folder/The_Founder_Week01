The Founder is game where the player can "found" their own company and how the player will market theirr brand.
As the founder the player makes key decisions on how your company will run and manage multiples aspects,
from assigning employees certain tasks and how their money is invested. The player can decide which area 
they would like to focus on, the player can either control if they want their company to either focus on 
hardware or software. The player can hire employees from different backgrounds with different skill sets. 
The player can negotiate their future employees wage. The player can invest in advertisement and research for 
future marketable products as well as expanding the company.The Founder is very simple and easy on the eyes but 
leaves much to be desired in terms of easing new players into the game, there is a bit of info dumping. 
The Founders replayabilty depends on how invested the player is in their company and dominating their market.
The Founder is a simple, yet complex game. It targets a very niche audience, in the end "The Founder" is either 
your cup of tea or it's not.
